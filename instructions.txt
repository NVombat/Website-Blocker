STEP1:
Locate the "hosts" file on your machine and save its path in a variable
"/etc/hosts" -> MAC & LINUX
r"C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts" -> WINDOWS

STEP2: (MAC & LINUX)
To run the python script from the terminal add "hosts" file  path to the original_hosts_path variable
Go to command line and type "sudo python3 blocker.py"
After running the previous command, type in your password and it will run

STEP2: (WINDOWS)
Locate the command line application
Right click the icon and click "Run As Administrator"
Use "cd" command to enter the directory where the python script is located
Type "python blocker.py" and run the command
The program runs

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TO MAKE THE WEBSITE BLOCKER RUN IN THE BACKGROUND AS A PROCESS WHEN THE LAPTOP STARTS:

WINDOWS:
We need to use pythonw.exe -> To run programs in the BACKGROUND
For this we change extension of script to .pyw -> blocker.pyw
Now double click on the program and it will run in the background
This can be verified in task manager -> pythonw.exe
However it will not run as the hosts file needs Administrator Access

Go to the Task Scheduler -> Create Task
Under "General" Name the task "Website Blocker" or any name you want
Under "General" check "Run with highest priveleges" so that it can access the hosts file
Under "Triggers" click on "New" and select "At Startup" for when to begin the program
Under "Actions" select "Run a program" and enter the program that is to be run -> blocker.pyw
Under "Conditions" Uncheck the power option that says to run only if AC Power is plugged in
Press "OK" and the task has been scheduled and the program should run in the background on Startup

LINUX & MAC:
We need to use the cron service to schedule the task
sudo crontab -e -> opens crontab file as an administrator
"@reboot python3 /home/nvombat/Desktop/Website-Blocker/blocker.py" Add this task to the crontab
Ctrl X Ctrl Y to save and exit

NOTE: USE ABSOLUTE PATHS AS THE SCHEDULERS WORK FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTORIES
NOTE: TO COPY "hosts" FILE ONTO DESKTOP OR ANY DIRECTORY -> "cp hosts /home/nvombat/Desktop" (Linux & MAC) (cp hosts path_where_file_is_being_copied)
